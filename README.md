# Interview findings

## Biker

## Driver (Uber)

## City Hall (chief of streets)
- what are the criteria
- what kind of data is hard to acquire and will be useful

## public health research lab

## pedestrian
- with bikers
	- A lot of conversation is around bikes and cars, but sometimes it is dangerous for us as well, pedestrians tend to be a vulnerable population (elderly or babies).
	- Hard because separated lanes will be unefficient for land usage

# Design challenge statement

- How do we know which places are dangerous and which places are not?
- How do we know whether we have a bike lane in the first place? Data of the current situation is already lacking

# Levers of Change

# Ideation
1. Make a Huge Bicycle that occupies the width of a car
- LED interface that communicates with the drivers
- Crowdsource data whether there is a bike lane or not 
- Collect data on how people think on road and share them with othersAsk them how the infrastructure will improve the current situation
- Guerrilla act on painting dangerous roads
- Guerrilla act on occupy parking lots with door less objects
- Design a parking structure
- Close roads, make it a plaza where anyone can meet
- Put roof structure in intersections so that bikes and peds can avoid rain and snow
- Put signage showing the average speed of cars and bicycles (rush hour)
- Hobo signs for bikers
- Record accelerometer data to detect sudden bumps
- Detect ring bells to indicate the place is unsafe (recording sound)
